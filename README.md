# IT Helpdesk Scenarios

This repository demonstrates practical IT helpdesk workflows by simulating real-world support scenarios.  
Using **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)** for account management and **Jira Service Management** for ticket documentation, the project covers common Tier 1 IT tasks such as password resets, account lockouts, and group management.  

Each scenario includes both the **technical fix** and the **corresponding helpdesk ticket lifecycle**, showcasing end-to-end IT support practices.  

In addition to serving as a personal portfolio project, this repository is also intended to support **aspiring IT technicians** by providing clear examples of common workflows and scenarios they will likely encounter in real environments. The goal is to help others gain confidence in handling these foundational IT tasks as they begin their careers.
